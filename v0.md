WolfPad v0 Design System

Overview
- Purpose: A single source of truth for WolfPad UI. Use this file (@v0.md) to guide all redesigns and features across desktop and mobile.
- Goals: Clarity, professional polish, futuristic/neon atmosphere, consistency, accessibility, responsiveness, and performance.

Core Principles
- Focus: Elevate essentials. Keep information density high but never cluttered.
- Consistency: Same spacing, colors, motion curves, and component primitives across pages.
- Depth: Use glass, neon glows, and subtle elevation to achieve a layered, futuristic aesthetic.
- Performance: Prefer lightweight surfaces and motion; avoid heavy shadows/filters in large lists.
- Accessibility: Maintain sufficient contrast, clear focus states, keyboard navigation, and reduced-motion support.

Breakpoints & Grid
- Breakpoints (content decisions, not strict CSS requirements):
  - xs: < 480
  - sm: 480–767
  - md: 768–1023 (tablet)
  - lg: 1024–1279 (desktop small)
  - xl: ≥ 1280 (desktop wide)
- Container: `wp-container` max-width 1200px; 16px side padding desktop, 12px on mobile.
- Layout grid: Prefer CSS grid for page frames and major sections; flex for internal alignment. Use gap scale.

Spacing, Radius, Elevation
- Spacing scale (px): 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48.
- Radii: Small 6; Medium 10; Large 16 (primary); Extra 24 for hero/feature panels; Hex/angle shapes via clip-path.
- Elevation: `hover-raise` for cards/panels; limit strong shadows to hover/focus. Use glass/neon layers instead of opaque heavy drop shadows.

Typography
- Font family: Inter (system fallback). Weights: 400, 500, 600, 700, 800.
- Sizes (desktop defaults; scale down ~10–15% on mobile):
  - h1: 32–36, h2: 24–28, h3: 18–20, body: 14–16, caption: 12–13
- Numeric: Use tabular-nums for money, stats, tables.
- Hierarchy: Strong titles with glow; secondary text softened (reduced contrast), avoid italics.

Color Tokens & Variables
- Use CSS variables for theme control. Common tokens (all themes must define):
  - --color-bg-main
  - --color-bg-panel
  - --color-bg-dark
  - --color-text-primary
  - --color-text-secondary
  - --color-text-on-accent
  - --color-border
  - --color-secondary-blue
  - --color-secondary-blue-rgb (comma-separated RGB)
  - --color-secondary-blue-glow
  - --color-primary-red
  - --color-primary-red-rgb
  - --color-primary-red-glow
- Glow usage: apply to active navigation, titles, progress, and key metrics (never to body paragraphs).

Surface Utilities (required classes)
- glass-panel: translucent layer with blur (approx 12px) on panel backgrounds.
- neon-border: 1px gradient border layer with subtle color interplay (blue→red).
- cut-corners: clipped corner accent for angular, futuristic panels.
- hover-raise: light translateY + soft shadow on hover.
- scanline: optional animated reflective sweep for hero panels.
- hex: geometric tile for stat blocks and badges.
- underline-glow: animated/colored underline for tabs/headers.

Motion & Interaction
- Engine: framer-motion for entrances and hover micro-transitions.
- Default durations: 180–250ms; small elements can be faster; complex panels 250–350ms.
- Easing: easeOutQuad for entrances; easeInOut for hover/transition loops.
- Reduced motion: honor prefers-reduced-motion — use fade-only or no motion.
- Feedback: focus-visible rings; subtle glow pulses only for critical confirmations.

Desktop Global Structure
- Header (full-width): left-aligned brand/logo; right cluster: global actions (language, theme, profile). Time tracker shows on desktop.
- Sidebar (minimal): icon-first vertical nav; labels on hover or when expanded. Keep it slim.
- Content: main container (`wp-container`). Panels use `glass-panel neon-border`.

Mobile Global Structure
- Header: compact; includes time tracker summary and primary action.
- Navigation: bottom nav bar with 4–5 primary destinations. “More” sheet slides up over dimmed backdrop; tap backdrop to close.
- Safe areas: always pad for `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` in nav and sheets.

Component Primitives
- Button: high-contrast on primary surfaces; accent background `--color-secondary-blue` with `--color-text-on-accent`. Ghost buttons: transparent + `--color-border`.
- Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter: rounded 16; `glass-panel neon-border` as needed. Preserve consistent inner padding (16–20).
- Tabs: pill or underline styles; active uses glow + accent color.
- Inputs/Selects: dark surfaces, 1px border; focused ring = accent blue.
- Progress: thin bar with glow when active.

Dashboard (Command Center)
- Frame: two-column layout on desktop.
  - Left (2/3): hero header panel; KPI tile grid (4 tiles); tabbed board (Today, Upcoming, Later); table-like header row; task list with hover-revealed actions.
  - Right (1/3): Quick Actions; Stats stack; Insights (7d completion sparkline, focus score).
- Mobile: hero then KPI grid, tabs as horizontal scroll; task list full width; insights stack below.
- Visuals: use glow-title on headers; `scanline` on hero only; keep animations subtle.

Goals
- Grid of goal cards (1 col mobile; 2 col desktop). Each card: title, progress bar, ratio, AI Breakdown action; expandable task list with add task inline.
- Cards: `glass-panel neon-border cut-corners hover-raise`. Use a blue top border/indicator for active goals.

Weekly (Kanban)
- Horizontal scroll columns with `DayColumn` width ~17–20rem on mobile, 20rem+ desktop.
- Column header shows weekday + date; right badge with pending count; column background brightens on drag-over.
- Cards: compact, show impact via color dot, tags, and hover-complete.

Personal Schedule (Routine)
- Desktop: 7 equal columns; day headers; donut ring for completion each day.
- Mobile: day selector carousel (buttons with 3-letter day), detail under it.
- Blocks: compact cards with time and a completion checkbox for today; delete is small, low-emphasis button.

Financials
- KPI tile grid: Income, Expenses, Net, Last 30d Spend; include sparklines and tabular-nums.
- Filters: date range, type (all/income/expense), category, search; budget input (optional) with utilization.
- Charts: categorical pie (filtered); net worth mini line; category heatmap.
- Transactions: sticky header table; zebra rows; right-aligned currency; quick delete.
- Export: CSV export for filtered list.

Personal Development
- Two-column layout: left planner/editor; right AI resources (collapsible accordions) and saved items.
- Provide empty states and skeleton loaders; integrate search/filter at top.

The Den (Journal)
- Today’s entry card at top; archive grouped by date sections.
- Editor: monospaced body with comfortable line-height; Save CTA aligned right.
- Archive list: keep entries simple; controls (edit/delete) appear inline on hover.

Analytics
- KPI stat cards row (e.g., completion rate, average impact, total tasks/week).
- Charts: line (trend), bar (by category), donut (distribution). Keep consistent colors across charts.
- Reports: list of insights with icons and brief descriptions in a `glass-panel`.

AI Agents
- Grid of agent cards with avatar/icon, description, status badge; card actions: configure/run.
- Emphasize states: active vs disabled via border/glow tone.

Settings
- Centered form within a `glass-panel`; sections for Profile, Theme, Language; save bar at bottom.
- Use segmented control for Theme selection with live preview.

Navigation & Tabs
- Desktop: underline style tabs in content sections (animated underline). Sidebar emphasizes current view with glow.
- Mobile: bottom nav icons glow blue when active; labels hidden on very narrow screens.

Logo & Branding
- Mark: Wolf icon inside neon gradient ring (blue/cyan primary). Keep the ring subtle; 2–3px inner glow.
- Logotype: “WolfPad” in bold; gradient text (blue→cyan) with a soft outer blue glow (spread <= 8px).
- Safe area: Minimum padding equal to 1× cap height around the mark/logotype.
- Dark backgrounds only; on bright surfaces, use monochrome version without glow.

Tables & Lists
- Headers: sticky with subtle border; use small uppercase labels and muted color.
- Rows: zebra backgrounds for readability; `hover-raise` disabled on dense lists (use background tint instead).
- Money/time: right-align with tabular numerals.

Charts
- Palette: blue/cyan for positive, red/magenta for negative, gray for neutral.
- Avoid default bright primaries; use desaturated fills with glowing strokes for emphasis.
- Axes/grid lines: low contrast; labels concise.

Accessibility
- Contrast: Body text ≥ 4.5:1; small text on glass surfaces must be checked in theme tokens.
- Focus: visible outlines (accent blue) on interactive elements.
- Motion: respect prefers-reduced-motion; provide equal information without animation.
- Touch targets: ≥ 40×40 on mobile.

Performance & Delivery
- Avoid third-party UI overlays in production.
- Prefer CSS variables + utility classes; minimize large box-shadow/filters in long lists.
- Defer heavy animations until in-view.

Implementation Notes
- Theme switching: via ThemeContext; persist selected theme in localStorage; apply to :root variables.
- Language switching: via LanguageContext; ensure provider value is stable and triggers re-renders.
- Safe-area handling: bottom nav and sheets must include `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding.

Migration Checklist (per page)
- Replace flat surfaces with `glass-panel neon-border`.
- Apply `cut-corners` to hero/feature panels; use `hover-raise` on interactive cards.
- Titles use glow-title; important numbers use tabular-nums.
- Ensure mobile layout: stacked sections, safe-area padding, bottom nav clearance.
- Verify reduced-motion and focus states.

Done Criteria
- Visual parity with this spec (surfaces, glow, spacing, motion) on desktop and mobile.
- No Tailwind CDN warnings; CSS via build pipeline.
- Direct production URLs (no wrappers) render without overlay scripts.
